  <description>
Colonists with Inspired Taming can now tame animals beyond their current skill level.
Mod settings provide three options to determine how far beyond:
- Tame any animal
- Boost by percentage
- Boost by levels

This does not change a colonist's actual Animals skill level.

### Compatibility 
- Compatible with RimWorld v1.1 and the Royalty DLC. 
- No known incompatibilities

### Notes
- Is perfectly safe to add or remove at any time from your save.
- Can be placed anywhere in the mod list.
- Doesn't add or remove anything - it just adds an extra allowance for
  inspired taming to CanInteractWithAnimal.
